Final Project 


So, for my final project I decided I wanted to do an analysis of firefighters and then also build a website where you could find all of the fire houses in NY. So, I used the google API to create a map that had every firehouse in NY state, with an exception of a few that did not have a location listed in Lat Long. Also, this data set did not include all of the individual fire houses in NYC. So, I found another data set of the stations in each broough and mapped them. 

Before making these maps, there was some clean up of the data I had to do. I had to make sure to drop the NA values in terms of lat long for both data sets. From there, I took both of these data frames and I uploaded them into SQL so they could be stored in a database. 

For the Firefighter analysis, I decided to do an analysis on the causes of fatalities for fire fighters. So, I had a data frame that listed every fatality from 2000 - the present (It may have been up to a few years ago, but it was the most recent data I found). 

In order to do a proper analysis on this, I felt it was necessary to take out data from September 11th, as that would potentially skew the data, as that was definitely an outlier of an event that caused a massive spike in the amount of fatalities. I feel strang talking about it in such a manner, as it was a major tragedy and it should be treated as such, but I still do think it necessary to drop that data. 

Significant findings: 

Stress/ overexertion accounts for more than half of the causes of death of fire fighters. This is surprising, because I would have thought it would be more directtly from something like getting burned or getting crushed. I don't know exactly how they are over exerting themselves, but it would interesting to see if its preventable or not. 



Volunteers account for more than half of the fatalities. This meams that most of the fatalities that occur are people that don't do it as their full time job. This is significant, because that factor could be directly why so many fire fighters are dying from stress & overexertion. Therefore, having volunteer fire fighters may bot be that great of an idea. Either that or there needs to be more physical standards for volunteers. I understand its likely hard to find volunteers, but it seems like something that can very much be prevented. 

Furthermore, they're dying while they're on duty & responding to fires. This really just shows that volunteer firefighters need to be trained more so they can be prepared. 



Further plans

As you can see, this really isn't a complete project. My goal was to complete as much of it as I could with the time I had. I'd like for this to eventually be a website where I launch it to increase awareness of fire safety and to help people prevent fires, etc. It would be interesting to continue to explore and figure out how many volunteer units there are in NY/ NYC. We can use that and then maybe we can create a fitness app thats specifically targeted at firefighters that also helps them with stress. It can link them up with Gyms near them, psychiatrists/ therapists near them, etc. etc. 

I plan on continuing with the direction I'm taking this in and I hope to have a cool resource for firefighters and civilians. I just really need to figure some more stuff out with launching apps and HTML. I'm looking forward ti getting better though.
